## Overview

Angular-based front-end application for the Empiria Financial Accounting System.

If you are interested in the former version of this software based on ASP and Visual Basic 6.0, that was built twenty years ago by our organization, please [visit this GitHub repository](https://github.com/Ontica/Sicofin-2002).

## Quick start

This project is being built with Angular 11 and TypeScript 4.

It uses [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli), so both the CLI and generated project, have dependencies that require Node 12 or higher, together with NPM 6 or higher.

**Make sure you have Node version >= 12 and NPM >= 6**

**Then install [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)** (globally if possible), ensuring that you have installed **version 11** or higher.

```bash
# install Angular CLI globally
npm install -g @angular/cli

# check Angular CLI, Angular and TypeScript versions
ng -v
```

After that, please download and install this repo:

```bash
# clone (or fork) this repo
git clone https://github.com/Ontica/Empiria.FinancialAccounting.Intranet

# change directory
cd Empiria.FinancialAccounting.Intranet


# install the repo with npm
npm install

# Use Angular CLI to start the server
ng serve --open
```

By default, you have to navigate to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) to see the application running.
